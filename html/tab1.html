<h3>Eratosthenes method</h3>

<p>
  Eratosthenes implemented basic mathematical knowledge, such as calculating the
  length of an arc of circumference to very accurately approximate the radius of
  the Earth, with only rudimentary instruments. Specifically, Eratosthenes
  observed the shadow produced by the Sun's rays during the summer solstice in
  two places far enough from each other: Siena (now the Egyptian city of Aswan)
  and Alexandria, located north of Siena following the same meridian.
  <br /><br />
  At solar noon of that day, in a deep well of Siena one could see for a very
  brief moment the reflection of the contained water, which showed that the rays
  fell perpendicularly, in that terrestrial parallel Eratosthenes located in
  Siena. However, at the same time, in Alexandria, located about 7 degrees
  further north, they fell slightly transversely, since the obelisks or a simple
  stick stuck in the ground cast a small but perceptible shadow. This in itself
  is a simple proof that the Earth cannot be flat, since if it were, even in
  Alexandria, at the same hour, the rays would have had to fall perpendicularly
  and cast no shadow.
  <br /><br />
  Eratosthenes started from a model of a round earth, shaped like a sphere, so
  he knew that the curvature of the earth would cause this effect. He devised a
  method to calculate the diameter of the sphere with only two data: the angle
  of incidence of the sun in Alexandria at the summer solstice (which is the
  same as the section of circumference that defines the two cities) and the
  distance between them. In this way, with a simple rule of three I could
  calculate the length of the circumference of the Earth. If the angle of
  incidence gives rise to an arc length of circumference equal to the distance
  between Alexandria and Siena, then 360 degrees (those of the full
  circumference) corresponds to the total length.
  <br /><br />
  To calculate the angle of incidence of the sun's rays in Alexandria at the
  summer solstice, he had to use notions of trigonometry, which were already
  known to Greek mathematicians, although using very different methods from
  those of today. In today's terminology, that angle of incidence is the value
  of the arctangent of the division between the shadow of an object and its
  height. Eratosthenes obtained a value close to 7.2 degrees.
  <br /><br />
  To complete his calculation he needed a sufficiently precise estimate of the
  distance between the two cities. It is said that Eratosthenes knew that a
  camel took fifty days to get from one city to the other, traveling about one
  hundred stadia per day, so he estimated the distance at about five thousand
  stadia. The accuracy of his calculation is an unknown, since the stadium is
  not a unit of measurement with a clear value. But, if we consider as a measure
  of a stadium the one corresponding to the Egyptian stadium (157.50 meters), we
  would obtain an approximate distance of 787.5 km. Substituting these values
  into the above rule of three gives a circumference length of 39,375 km. This
  is an excellent approximation of the true value, which is about 40,075 km at
  the equator.
