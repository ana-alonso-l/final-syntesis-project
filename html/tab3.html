<h3>Carbon-14</h3>

<p>
  Carbon-14 dating, also called radiocarbon dating, is a method of age
  determination that depends on the decay of radiocarbon (carbon-14) into
  nitrogen. Carbon-14 is continuously formed in nature by the interaction of
  neutrons with nitrogen-14 in the Earth's atmosphere; the neutrons necessary
  for this reaction are produced by cosmic rays interacting with the atmosphere.
  <br /><br />
  The radiocarbon present in atmospheric carbon dioxide molecules enters the
  biological carbon cycle: green plants absorb it from the air and then transmit
  it to animals through the food chain. Radiocarbon decays slowly in a living
  organism, and the amount lost is continually replenished whenever the organism
  takes in air or food. However, once the organism dies, it stops absorbing
  carbon-14 , so the amount of radiocarbon in its tissues decreases steadily.
  Carbon-14 has a half-life of 5730 Â± 40 years, i.e. , half the amount of the
  radioisotope present at any given time will undergo spontaneous decay . over
  the next 5,730 years. Because carbon-14 decays at this constant rate, an
  estimate of when an organism died can be made by measuring the amount of its
  residual radiocarbon.
  <br /><br />
  The carbon-14 method was developed by American physicist Willard F. Libby
  around 1946. It has proven to be a versatile technique for dating fossils and
  archaeological specimens from 500 to 50,000 years old. The method is widely
  used by geologists, anthropologists, archaeologists and Pleistocene
  researchers in related fields.
