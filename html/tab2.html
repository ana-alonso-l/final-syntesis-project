<h3>The parallax method</h3>

<p>
  The parallax method is based on classical geometry and consists of observing
  the displacements that are produced in the apparent position of the stars as
  the Earth moves around the Sun.
  <br /><br />
  This method can be appreciated with a simple experiment : place your finger
  thumb close to your nose and alternately wink your eyes. You will notice that
  the thumb moves from left to right with respect to the background, if you
  repeat the operation with the arm extended, you will see that the displacement
  with respect to the background of the thumb is less. This perspective effect
  is known as parallax and can also be observed in the stars. As the Earth
  revolves around the Sun in a year, our position, our "eye", does not have a
  fixed position. On January 1 and July 1 (six months later) the Earth occupies
  diametrically opposite positions in its orbit.
</p>

<p>
  On those two dates, a nearby star (A) will be seen at different positions with
  respect to the backdrop of stars and constellations farther away. By
  complicated procedures, astronomers have managed to calculate the angle p
  (called the parallax of that star); p is the angle at which the radius of the
  Earth's orbit would be seen from that star.
  <br /><br />
  As the distance to the stars is very large, these angles, as shown in the
  following table, are always very small, in the order of fractions of 1
  arcsecond, i.e., very small. Until the telescopes were not powerful enough, it
  was not possible to measure the parallax of any star. The first time it was
  achieved was in 1838, when the German astronomer Friedrich Bessel managed to
  measure the parallax of the star 61 Cygni. But what matters to us is that this
  angle only depends on the distance, and vice versa: knowing this angle we can
  calculate the distance.
  <br /><br />
  The usual unit for measuring astronomical distances is the light-year: the
  distance light travels in one year. To simplify calculations, astronomers have
  devised a new unit of distance: the parsec (pc). 1 parsec (short for parallax
  second) is the distance a star has to be so that its parallax angle is p = 1″.
  The equivalence between the two units is 1 pc = 3.26 light years.
</p>
<h3>Trigonometric calculation of distances by parallax:</h3>

<p>
  The line AT2 is tangent to the earth orbit so it is also perpendicular to the
  radius ST2 and the triangle ST2A is a right-angled triangle (T2 = 90º).
  Therefore sin p = ST2/SA
  <br /><br />
  If p = 1" → sin 1" = 150-106 km / SA → SA
  <br /><br />
  = 150-106 km/sin 1"
  <br /><br />
  SA = 1 pc (by definition) = 150-106 km/0.00000485
  <br /><br />
  = 3.09-1013 km (almost 31-1012 km!)
  <br /><br />
  As 1 light year = 300,000-60-60-24-365
  <br /><br />
  = 9.46-1012 km
  <br /><br />
  It turns out that 1 pc = 3.09-1013 km/9.46-1012 km
  <br /><br />
  = 3.26 light years
