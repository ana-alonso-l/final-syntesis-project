  A physical quantity is something that can be measured. For any measurement,
  the unit used must be indicated to give an idea of ​​the scale of the
  measurement.

  <br /><br />
  For example, distance can be measured in kilometers or miles. They are
  similar, but not the same, and it is important to identify which one was used
  for the measurement, so that you know what the distance really is.

  <br /><br />
  - kelvin (K) – unit of temperature

  <br /><br />
  - Mole (mol) – unit of the amount of substance

  <br /><br />
  <br /><br />
  - Frequency - hertz

  <br /><br />
